	 * OWF-1052: The asJSON method was calling StringEscapeUtils.escapeJavaScript on class variables. This
	 * was causing the escaped values to be saved to the database. For example; let say you created a
	 * preference with the value of "I can't do it". After you saved it was stored in the db as entered.
	 * Then you refresh your admin screen. Now the database has "I can\'t do it". What happened? Well, the
	 * preference list rest call was calling the asJSON method of each retrieved preference. Whenever a
	 * parse error occurred when trying to generate the JSON (which was the first time you hit a character
	 * that needs to be escaped in JS) we would escape the characters in the class variable. This was marking
	 * them dirty in GORM and being committed back to the db when the transaction committed (even on a list
	 * or a show)
